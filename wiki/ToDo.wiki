#summary Things which need doing

  * [http://mpris.org/ MPRIS]-compliant DBUS player track-info retrival
  * Sensible WMP support
  * ~~XMPP tune status support~~
  * ~~Other outstanding patches~~
  * ~~issues with track info containing hyphens? winamp related?~~
  * XMMS2 support needs work: should use dlopen/dlsym to avoid depedning on presence of library (detected at compile time at the moment)
  * Last.fm feed support needs work: breaks player autodetection at the momeent, should look at timestamp and infer off it is more than 5 minutes (configurable?) in the past; look at what [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-lastfm/ pidgin-lastfm] does?
