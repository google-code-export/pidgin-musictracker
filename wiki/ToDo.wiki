#summary Things which need doing

  * [http://mpris.org/ MPRIS]-compliant DBUS player track-info retrival
  * Sensible WMP support
  * ~~XMPP tune status support~~
  * ~~Other outstanding patches~~
  * ~~issues with track info containing hyphens? winamp related?~~
  * XMMS2 support needs work: should use dlopen/dlsym to avoid depedning on presence of library (detected at compile time at the moment)
  * ~~Last.fm feed support needs work: breaks player autodetection at the momeent, should look at timestamp and infer off it is more than 5 minutes (configurable?) in the past; look at what [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-lastfm/ pidgin-lastfm] does?~~
  * Generate reasonable linux binary packages (hopefully without needing a system with each kind of linux distrubution on)
  * When regex matching fails, log something useful
  * Are we leaking memory every time we pcre_compile? Check for leaks generally...
  * Use purple_plugin_pref() API rather than GTK directly?
  * Player auto-detection with asynchronous track info retrieval: 2 passes, first to launch all the data requests, the second to collect them all (fold remaining synchronous retrieval into the collect phase?); evaluate if more than one player has returned info and break ties using the list of players we use sequentially at the moment (so no change in apparent behaviour); perhaps this can lead to only retrying autodection if the player we have found goes away? (or at least increasing the autodetection interval?)
