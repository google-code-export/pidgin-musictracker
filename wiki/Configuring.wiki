#summary Configuring your music player and musictracker to work together

= How do I configure my player and musictracker to work together?==

Some players require additional plugins/features to be turned on/a specific configuration to help musictracker get the track information. 

== Windows Players ==

||[http://www.aimp.ru AIMP2]||Supported via the 'winamp-compatible' interface.||
||[http://www.foobar2000.org/ Foobar2000]||foobar2000 works best with a component installed to help musictracker get the track information (See [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-musictracker/wiki/FAQ#8 FAQ #8]) and musictracker's player setting set to 'auto-detect' or 'messenger compatible'.  The foobar2000-specific player interface will be removed at some future date.||
||[http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/ iTunes]||Supported via the iTunes interface.  The iTunes installer seems to have a bug so that sometimes upgrading iTunes breaks the COM interface, see [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-musictracker/wiki/FAQ#16 FAQ#16]. You'll need to uninstall and reinstall iTunes using the full download to work around this.||
||[http://www.last.fm/download Last.fm client]||Supported via the 'MSN Messenger compatible' interface.||
||[http://www.mediamonkey.com/ MediaMonkey]||Supported via the 'winamp-compatible' interface.  Unicode characters in song titles may not be reported correctly, see [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-musictracker/issues/detail?id=14 bug #14].||
||Media Player Classic||Supported via the 'MSN Messenger compatible' interface.  'Send "Now Playing" information to MSN Messenger' needs to be turned on in the player's options.||
||[http://openpandora.googlepages.com/ OpenPandora]||Supported via the 'MSN Messenger compatible' interface.||
||[http://getsongbird.com/ Songbird]||Supported via the 'MSN Messenger compatible' interface.  Install the [http://addons.songbirdnest.com/addon/1204 LiveTweeter] plugin for Songbird and turn on 'Activate MSN/!WindowsLive Messenger' in the plugins settings.||
||[http://www.spotify.com/ Spotify]||Supported via the 'MSN Messenger compatible' interface.||
||[http://www.winamp.com/ Winamp]||Supported via the 'winamp-compatible' interface.||
||[http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/default.aspx Windows Media Player]|| Supported via the 'Windows Media Player' interface.  This requires the 'uICE WMP Plug-in' for Windows Media Player, which should be automatically installed and enabled by the musictracker installer.  See [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-musictracker/wiki/FAQ#7 FAQ#7] for help if that fails to happen.  We don't think this works with 64-bit WMP.<br>Also supported via the 'MSN Messenger compatible' interface. You may need to install "Windows Live Messenger" and then enable the 'Windows Live Messenger Music' plugin (under Now Playing (little down arrow at the bottom of button)/Plugins/Other (or View/Plugins/Other if you have normal menus enabled)).||
||[http://wwwct.ttplayer.com/index.html TTplayer]||Supported via the 'MSN Messenger compatible' interface.||
||[http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ VLC]||Supported via the 'MSN Messenger compatible' interface.  ''MSN Now Playing' needs to be turned on in the player's preferences, found under 'Control Interfaces' when 'Show settings' is set to 'all'.||
