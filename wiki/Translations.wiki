pidgin-musictracker supports a translatable UI. Additional translations and updates and corrections to existing translations are welcome.   The translations can be edited online at [https://translations.launchpad.net/pidgin-musictracker/trunk/+pots/musictracker Launchpad].  You will need to create a Launchpad account to add to translations.

_Alternatively, if you don't want to use Launchpad_

The file [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-musictracker/source/browse/trunk#trunk/po po/musictracker.pot] is a template containing all the translatable messages.  You can create an empty translation file by copying and editing it or by using the [http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Creating msginit] program provided by GNU gettext.  Add the translated text for _msgid_ lines to the _msgstr_ lines, and raise a new issue with your translation file attached.
