#summary ChangeLog

*Changes in 0.4.20*
  * Reformat configure output when a package check fails, to make it a bit easier for people to read and understand that development packages are required
  * Add/update some more translations contributed via launchpad (added: Danish(da), Swedish(sv), Simplified Chinese(zn_CN); updated:  Low German(nds), Dutch(nl), Polish(pl), Norwegian Bokmal(nb), French(fr), German(de))
  * Fix snapshot script not do to anything if svn is unavailable; Don't wait for koji builds to complete in snapshot script; Launchpad snapshots are now built for ubuntu karmic as well
  * Improve release script to create a clean working directory before starting

*Changes in 0.4.19*
  * Update snapshot scripts so launchpad builds are requested for all active Ubuntu releases; include translations in the snapshot .deb packages
  * Autogen.sh replaces reconf; this properly updates ltmain.sh, fixing a problem when building from source (issue 104)
  * Distinguish between 'player closed' and 'player stopped' states more clearly.  When in the 'player closed' state, we always leave the status message alone.(issue 65)
  * Added a tooltip to tell people the effect of leaving the status format string blank is to keep using the status message selected in the pidgin status selector (issue 66)
  * Add support for fetching track information from the Last.fm webservices API 2.0 (issue 89)
  * Fix the legacy Last.fm track information fetcher to present a proper !UserAgent identifier and plug an enormous memory leak.
  * Remove a hardcoded limit to buffer-size in debug output
  * Improvements to Windows installer: add !RequestExecutionLevel to installer script (should avoid some Vista issues), add an uninstaller script, set compressor to LZMA (slightly reduces download size)
  * Add/update some more translations contributed via [https://translations.launchpad.net/pidgin-musictracker/trunk/+pots/musictracker launchpad] (added: Russian(ru); updated:  Italian(it), Spanish(es), Polish(pl), French(fr), Norwegian Bokmal(nb) translations)

*Changes in 0.4.18*
  * Fix the Spanish translation, so that the translation of '!MusicTracker' menu item is not a translation of the instructions to translators for translating the '!MusicTracker' menu item, but a translation of the '!MusicTracker' menu item.
  * Fix a bug preventing track time retrieval from banshee 1.0; it's a uint not an int
  * Tidy up XMMS interface to reduce debug output spam and fix a memory leak
  * Avoid a dlopen() leak if libaudacious.so and libxmms.so are both present
  * Rewrite status message generation to allow the addition of "%s" in the message format as the pidgin saved status and clarify the logic a lot (issue 19)
  * More adjustments to MSN compatible WM_COPYDATA message catcher, to deal with the message in the form [http://www.spotify.com/ Spotify] sends (issue 128).
  * Correct a mistake in the WM_COPYDATA parser which meant album information wasn't captured in one possible format.
  * It seems that the MSN compatible WM_COPYDATA parser was incorrect and the artist and title were swapped in lots of cases; try to impove this so the "swap artist and title" preference shouldn't need to be turned on so often.
  * Minor corrections and additions to French(fr) and Spanish(es) translations. Add partial Indonesian(id) translation, contributed via [https://translations.launchpad.net/pidgin-musictracker/trunk/+pots/musictracker launchpad]
  * Add a fallback to g_timeout_add() when built with GLib versions prior to 2.14.0, which do not have g_timeout_add_seconds() (issue 125)
  * Apply a patch to fix XMMS2 0.6 track information retrieval from chewi (issue 71). This change is incompatible with XMMS2 <=0.5
  * Remove .ebuild file from release upload, since there is now one in portage. 

*Changes in 0.4.17*
  * Avoid pidgin plugin search path confusion for those building from source by installing into the prefix which pidgin was configured with by default (issue 116)
  * Add/update some more translations contributed via [https://translations.launchpad.net/pidgin-musictracker/trunk/+pots/musictracker launchpad] (added: Dutch(nl), Norwegian Bokmal(nb); updated: German(de), Italian(it), Spanish(es))
  * Fix a terrible crash-causing brown-paper bag bug.  Wrongly filed as Pidgin [http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/8756 trac ticket #8756]
  * Make sure mostrecent_ti.player is initialized to something, avoiding a crash if you start with status changing deactivated, but then activate status changing before you've played anything. (Issue 107)
  * Snapshot script changes to request RPM buid on Koji; only do snapshot builds after a change is commited; use svn rev number in snapshot name

*Changes in 0.4.16*
  * Correct an issue with the toolchain I was using to build the Windows binaries, so they don't crash with "illegal instruction" on pentium III and earlier processors (issue 76)
  * Various packaging script improvements, add an initial attempt at RPM .spec file
  * For packaging convenience, add a --disable-werror configure option
  * Be a bit more careful checking if a dbus name has an owner, and add a bit more logging (appears to resolve issue 103)
  * Cause the status to update immediately after status changing is activated (rather than not until the next time the track information changes) (issue 100)
  * Audit uses of sccanf() for checking the return value correctly
  * Fix annoying "close pidgin, close player, open pidgin, 'now listening' doesn't get cleared" bug (again), reintroduced by r271 (also fixed by pidgin 2.5.5 which properly understands tune status shouldn't be saved)

*Changes in 0.4.15*
  * Use a proper plugin ID and stop bogusly claiming to be a core plugin in debug output
  * Change "Broken 'now listening'" to "Don't use 'now listening'" to clarify and make it's use more general (issue 86)
  * Avoid a warning from a debug build of dbus library if dbus connection could not be established
  * Tweak a few strings for clarity
  * Try harder to avoid "MSN Error: Friendly name changes too rapidly" (issue 78)
  * Fix sequence of actions so that the per-protocol disable setting clears the status message immediately when it's set (issue 85)
  * Avoid spamming 'sh: mocp: not found' to stderr in autodetect mode when mocp isn't installed (issue 96)
  * Don't set 'now playing' when player is paused (issue 92)
  * Make the Windows installer slightly more knowlegable about where pidgin is installed, to help picking our install directory
  * Properly install translations for languages pidgin doesn't have translations of (issue 97)
  * Add/update some more translations contributed via [https://translations.launchpad.net/pidgin-musictracker/trunk/+pots/musictracker launchpad] (added: Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, French, German (Low), Hebrew, Polish, Slovenian, Spanish; updated: German, Portugese (Brazilian))
  * Fix a random crash at plugin load (issue 106)
  * Remove the use of fixed sized buffers for preference name formatting, which could be causing crashes with longish usernames
  * Fix a bug causing some track information from winamp longer than 50 characters to end in garbage characters (issue 102)

*Changes in 0.4.14*
  * Correct encoding for it.po to UTF-8; Set the codeset for musictracker domain to UTF-8 (fixes issue 69)
  * Adjust WM_COPYDATA message parsing yet again, so it works with the format used by TTplayer as well (part of issue 70)
  * Try to make it a bit clearer in the player selection dropdown that the Amarok DCOP interface is only for Amarok 1 (Amarok 2 uses the MPRIS interface)
  * Avoid a potential initial crash in lastfm feed code
  * Apply patch for Vagelume player support by Juan A. Suarez Romero (issue 72)
  * Apply patch for MOC support by Peter Vizi (issue 74)
  * Updated .ebuild file, add ./configure options --enable-xmm2 and --disable-xmms2 to allow control of if XMMS2 client support is built in or not (issue 77)
  * Align Win32 build flags with those used by pidgin
  * Fix some more warnings
  * Add some more translations (portugese, german) contributed via [https://translations.launchpad.net/pidgin-musictracker/trunk/+pots/musictracker launchpad]

*Changes in 0.4.13*
  * Fix filter to operate on whole words only (issue 51)
  * Fix filter to operate on 'now listening', not just the status message
  * Add an option to swap artist and title in the received MSN-messenger compatible WM_COPYDATA message, as some people are apparently getting them from some player applications in the opposite order for reasons which are unclear (It seems the Last.fm *client* needs this setting turned on, for one)
  * Add linux [http://getsongbird.com/ songbird] player support via [http://addons.songbirdnest.com/addon/181 dbusbird] interface (issue 41) (Note that dbusbird currently has a few limitations: it truncates title to 30 characters, and stopped status doesn't seem to be reported reliably)
  * Add translation support using gettext (*NOTE*: To be consistent with the location of the translation files, musictracker now installs the plugin into the prefix specified to ./configure, rather than directly into the pidgin plugin directory found using pidgin's pkg-config file.  Since pidgin installed into /usr doesn't appear to search for plugins in /usr/local by default, this means that people building from source may well need to do './configure --prefix=/usr' where previously './configure' has done the right thing for them...)
  * Add italian translation by Alessio Fachechi (issue 67) (Other translations are welcome.  The file [http://code.google.com/p/pidgin-musictracker/source/browse/trunk#trunk/po po/musictracker.pot] is a template containing all the translatable messages)
  * Deal with AIMP2's implementation of the winamp interface (issue 61)
  * Added reported classname for Foobar2000 ColumnsUI (issue 53) 
  * Try again to get the dbus-glib dependency in .ebuild right (issue 55)

*Changes 0.4.12*
  * Relax and refine the regex used for matching MSN "now listening" messages; track info from VLC should work again (issue 46)
  * Remove a fixed size buffer from capture() utility function
  * Add a per-account "tune status is broken" configuration to work around the problem that libpurple tells us googletalk accounts have tune status, but it doesn't actually work (and I can't work out a good way to detect this situation automatically) *Note:* This is on by default for all XMPP accounts, for non-!GoogleTalk XMPP accounts with working XEP-0118 you should clear this setting (issue 26)
  * Merge some fixes to problems found with valgrind (fixes warnings when compiled with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2) (issue 44)
  * Remove m4 directory from build, we don't actually make any macros (stops ebuild installing empty /usr/share/aclocal), see gentoo bug #180771
  * Update and correct dbus-glib dependency in .ebuild
  * Fix a rare crash when data retrieval from last.fm fails (issue 35)

*Changes in 0.4.11*
  * Fix "status doesn't clear when status changing is deactivated" bug (issue #37), more collateral breakage from change for issue #32
  * Reorder menu actions so disable/enable is the first one, as it's probably the most used

*Changes in 0.4.10*
  * Fix terrible bug introduced by change for issue #32, which utterly broke tune status support (e.g."now listening" in MSN) (issue #36)

*Changes in 0.4.9*
  * Update configure check for dbus-glib to 0.73, needed for dbus_g_proxy_call_with_timeout (issue #34)
  * Fix /nowplaying to get correct information when status changing is disabled (issue #32)
  * Fix a problem with the msn compatibility message handler which behaved badly when Winamp had stopped in auto-detect mode
  * Avoid a crash mode in winamp message handling seen with musikCube (due to it's limited Winamp compatibility interface)
  * Fix crash with audacious caused by a rather obvious mistake (issue #28, issue #33)
  * Audit uses of G_TYPE_STRING returned from a dbus call and fix a couple of leaks
  * Make MPRIS player detection fully dynamic, scanning for org.mpris. service names; add an additional hint needed for dragonplayer to work.
  * Generalize MSN message support a little bit more
  * Avoid a potential null dereference in xmms2 debug output
  * Rewrite MPRIS debug code to avoid use of GHashTableIter, so we work with all GLib > 2.0.0, and so don't have a different GLib dependency to pidgin itself

*Changes in 0.4.8*
  * Add patch from Phillip Camp for !SqueezeCenter/!SlimServer support 
  * Fix a crash which could occur if an account is added whilst musictracker is loaded
  * Add a fallback method for getting track information by catching messages intended to pass that info to MSN Messenger.  Tested with VLC 0.8.6i (you need to turn on the "MSN Now-Playing" control interface), Media Player Classic (turn on 'Send "Now Playing" information to MSN Messenger'), Songbird + !LiveTweeter add-on, hopefully works with other stuff as well.  This is now the preferred interface for foobar2000, as it works better than reading the window title and guessing :-)
  * Fix foobar2000 title parsing for the case where the track has no album information
  * Add MPRIS-compliant player track information support.  Lightly tested with VLC 0.9.1 (you need to turn on "D-Bus Control Interface" in settings), BMPx 0.40, Audacious 1.4.  Feedback wanted!

*Changes in 0.4.7*
  * Correct the way we retrieve track artist info from WMP (issue #16)
  * Fix a problem where tune status could sometimes get left with stale data (e.g. if player was closed whilst pidgin was closed)
  * Apply patch from hyperair adding a timeout to dbus calls, so they cannot block indefinitely (hanging pidgin) if something has gone wrong in the target application (issue #13)
  * Fix restoring saved status so it correctly restores account-specific saved status (issue #11)
  * Attempt to avoid being told "MSN: Friendly name changes too rapidly" when player is stopped
  * Some more tidying up
  * Update libmpdclient to latest svn (revision 7402) (this fixes a file descriptor leak when an IPv6-enabled MPD is running) (#137, maybe issue #12?)
  * Enable MPD client in windows build
  * Fix type conversion warnings when building for x64 (issue #18)
  * Use dopen/dlsym to access XMMS2 client library, so it doesn't become a run-time dependency if we build with XMMS2 support enabled

*Changes in 0.4.6*
  * Rewrite WMP support using disphelper from http://disphelper.sourceforge.net/ and WMPuICE by Christian Mueller from http://www.mediatexx.com.  Hopefully this rewrite has several advantages: It works without needing any changes of configuration of WMP, now uses a wide-char interface so should be able to transport unicode chars successfully.  Feedback wanted!
  * Restore support for non-widechar Winamp interface, as a fall-back if preferred interface fails.  This restores compatability with older versions of Winamp, and the Winamp-compatible interface which !MediaMonkey supports 

*Changes in 0.4.5*
  * Various fixes to avoid crash modes where track information is longer than expected
  * Compilation warnings fixes
  * Improve foobar2000 and winamp interface code to work better for track info using east asian characters.  *Note:* Winamp 5.13 (circa 2006) or later is now required.  I suppose I could put some legacy compatability code in for those people who must use Winamp 2 :-).  Windows Media Player still needs work in this area, everything else should be fine.
  * Do PCRE_STATIC properly (only applies to windows builds and tells us to use a static library)
  * Improve last.fm feed interface: infer player is off if scrobble timestamp is older than a configurable interval, configure polling interval as well
  * Add some possibly needed pcre_free()s

*Changes in 0.4.4* "I suppose I should fix that...."
  * Store musictracker per-account preferences using both screen name and protocol as the key, so that multiple accounts with the same screen name on different protocols may have different musictracker status formatting setttings.  *Note:* No attempt is made to migrate existing per-account settings, it's ambigious which account they belong to and I'm lazy :S (issue #2)
  * Strip windows DLL before making installer (so it's not huge!) (issue #4)
  * Restore UI selected status when musictracker is unloaded (#114)
  * Fix tune status support to work with msnp15, coming in pidgin 2.5.0, add UI to disable personal message changing if we have tune status (issue #3) *Note:* pidgin 2.5.0 isn't released yet, so this won't do anything unless you are running a development version. Don't run development versions of pidgin unless you are willing to keep both pieces when it breaks :-)
  * Add ability to disable status changing whilst away
  * Add a simple implementation of a "/nowplaying" or "/np" command
  * Fix way amarok and iTunes interface code deals with times greater than 60 minutes (#22)
  * Fix exaile interface code to retrieve current position in track correctly (was broken!)
  * Tidy up some debug output and general cruft
  * Add a bit of defensive code against a possible crash (issue #5)

*Changes in 0.4.3* "patch frenzy"
  * patch from chet.the.gray for Listen player support (#13)
  * patch from puthali.HB for Last.fm feed support (#48)
  * patch from patrick.dessalle for Audacious 1.4 support (#86)
  * patch from hyperair for Banshee 1.0 support (#87)
  * patch from thelrix for XMPP user tune support (#96)
  * patch from !ZeeGeek for XMMS2 player support (#121)
  * Rhythmbox: Slightly improve the way we report information for streams (#35), based on a patch by eemil.lagerspetz
  * Improve "Toggle status changing" action so it has a dynamic menu item which reflects the current Enabled/Disabled state (#39), based on a patch by TorresMAT
  * Winamp: don't screw up titles which contain hyphens, try to still do something useful with streams (#59) based on a patch by leonardo.monteiro.fernandes
  * amarok: Check for running dcopserver to avoid problems when dcop blocks for long enough that we appear to hang pidgin (#68), Don't spam stderr with "call failed" errors from trying to dcop amarok
  * Add missing header include to fix Gentoo QA notice on build (#138)

*Changes in 0.4.2*
  * Fix finding window for Foobar2000 0.9.5.3 and later
  * Don't crash if track info from player isn't valid UTF-8!
  * Get UTF-8 track info from iTunes and WMP
  * Avoid damaging valid UTF-8 track info when removing unprintable characters
  * If the track info message is empty, try to restore the status message selected in UI (e.g. for when your player stopped message is empty)
  * Remove use of modified MSN protocol plugin to append now-playing info to nickname (I suggest you use pidgin 2.5.0 or later or [http://code.google.com/p/msn-pecan/ msn-pecan] which supports personal messages)
  * Fixed to build with latest purple
