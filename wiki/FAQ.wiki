= I installed musictracker, started my player and my status doesn't change =

Your outgoing status message is changed, as your correspondents should be able to tell you, but the status message shown in the pidgin UI is not updated.

This behaviour, whilst failing to provide clearly needed user feedback, is by design, at least for the moment.

Adding yourself to your own buddy list (if permitted by the protocol) may be one way of seeing your own status, or enabling the [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/mystatusbox MyStatusBox] plugin from the [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/PluginPack Pidgin Plugin Pack]

= Windows installer fails "Error opening the file for writing musictracker.dll" =

You must exit pidgin to run the installer if you have a previous version of musictracker installed.

= Doesn't work with Windows Media Player =

Sigh.

You must enable the plugin called "True Launch Bar Remote Control" in Windows Media
Player (accessible from the little arrow underneath Now Playing, Plugins, Other).

This plugin is implemented by wmp9.dll and seems to provide the hook needed for reporting WMP status messages.

I've removed wmp9.dll from the pidgin-musictrcker installer as the distribution rights are unclear.  Googling for "True Launch Bar" should find it :-)

Needless to say, this is a complete crock and needs re-writing.
