*I installed musictracker, started my player and my status doesn't change*

Your outgoing status message is changed, as your correspondents should be able to tell you, but the status message shown in the pidgin UI is not updated.

This behaviour, whilst failing to provide clearly needed user feedback, is by design, at least for the moment.

Adding yourself to your own buddy list (if permitted by the protocol) may be one way of seeing your own status, or enabling the [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/mystatusbox MyStatusBox] plugin from the [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/PluginPack Pidgin Plugin Pack]

*MSN status messages aren't working at all*

musictracker 0.4.1 installs a custom libmsn.dll/.so, which is now quite old and doesn't support MSN custom status messages.  If this libmsn is still on your system, MSN custom status messages won't work.  This could happen if you installed pidgin, then installed musictracker 0.4.1, then updated musictracker.

The solution is to reinstall pidgin.
==3==
* Windows installer fails "Error opening the file for writing musictracker.dll" *

You must exit pidgin to run the installer if you have a previous version of musictracker installed.

If you have installed pidgin somewhere other than the default location of  "C:\Program Files\Pidgin", you must tell the musictracker installer the correct location for pidgin.

==4==
*How do I uninstall musictracker? *

  * Delete C:\Program Files\Pidgin\plugins\musictracker.dll
  * Run regsvr32 /u "C:\Program Files\Pidgin\wmpuice.dll"
  * Delete C:\Program Files\Pidgin\wmpuice.dll
  * Delete any musictracker.mo files from C:\Program Files\Pidgin\locale\`*`\LC_MESSAGES

==5==
* How do I get my status to go back to the pidgin status message when player stops? *

Change the "Stopped/Off" Status Format in the musictracker plugin configuration to an
empty string.

==6==
* Player name is shown as "unknown" *

It is a limitation of the "MSN compatible" now playing interface that the player name is
not available, so %r is replaced with "unknown" in this case.

A useful [http://kentie.net/article/nowplaying/index.htm description of this interface]

==7==
* Doesn't work with Windows Media Player (0.4.5 and earlier)*

Sigh.

You must enable the plugin called "True Launch Bar Remote Control" in Windows Media
Player (accessible from the little arrow underneath Now Playing, Plugins, Other).

This plugin is implemented by wmp9.dll and seems to provide the hook needed for reporting WMP status messages.

I've removed wmp9.dll from the pidgin-musictrcker installer as the distribution rights are unclear.  Googling for "True Launch Bar" should find it :-)

Needless to say, this was a complete crock and was re-writtten for 0.4.6

==8==
* Doesn't work with foobar2000 (artist/track/title are blank) *
 
foobar2000 player support is pretty fragile

  * The title format needs to be the default "[%album artist% - ]['['%album%[ CD%discnumber%][ #%tracknumber%]']' ]%title%[ '//' %track artist%]"
  * The player paused state isn't detected
  * It doesn't work when player is set to minimize to tray

You can use the [http://chron.visiondesigns.de/foobar2000/#foo_winamp_spam winamp spam] component

With later versions of musictracker not using winamp_spam actually works better, as some winamp messages we use aren't implemented, and foobar2000 sends "now playing" messages for MSN, which we now catch.

==9==
* How do I build from source? *

Download and unpack the pidgin-musictracker-n.n.nn.tar.bz2 source package, then

{{{
./configure
make
}}}

for Windows

{{{
make -f Makefile.mingw installer
}}}

For the Windows build, as we currently rely on some of the pidgin build infrastructure,  you'll also need the pidgin source at the relative path ../pidgin,  with a win32-dev/ which has been populated by the Windows build dependency fetcher, winpidgin-build-fetcher.sh.  This source needs to be buildable, i.e. have an appropriate config.h and local.mak.

We don't provide and install a dynamic libpcre, so a static libpcre also needs to be made available, one approach is to place that in a directory under win32-dev/ and add that directory to the LIB_PATH set in local.mak

==10==
* How to I build the source from subversion? *

Usually, you don't!  The source tarballs available on the downloads page are nearly always a much better choice.  If you must have absolutely the lastest source, try the snapshots page.  But if you really want to build from subversion:

Perform the following steps before ./configure

{{{
echo my-hacked-up-version >version
./reconf
}}}
