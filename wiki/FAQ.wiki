*I installed musictracker, started my player and my status doesn't change*

Your outgoing status message is changed, as your correspondents should be able to tell you, but the status message shown in the pidgin UI is not updated.

This behaviour, whilst failing to provide clearly needed user feedback, is by design, at least for the moment.

Adding yourself to your own buddy list (if permitted by the protocol) may be one way of seeing your own status, or enabling the [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/mystatusbox MyStatusBox] plugin from the [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/PluginPack Pidgin Plugin Pack]

*MSN status messages aren't working at all*<br>
*MSN disconnects when I set invisible status*<br>
*MSN protocol behaves strangely*<br>

musictracker 0.4.1 installs a custom libmsn.dll/.so, which is now quite old and doesn't support MSN custom status messages.  If this libmsn is still on your system, MSN custom status messages won't work.  This could happen if you installed pidgin, then installed musictracker 0.4.1, then updated musictracker.

The solution is to reinstall pidgin.
==3==
* Windows installer fails "Error opening the file for writing musictracker.dll" *

You must exit pidgin to run the installer if you have a previous version of musictracker installed.

If you have installed pidgin somewhere other than the default location of  "C:\Program Files\Pidgin", you must tell the musictracker installer the correct location for pidgin.

==4==
*How do I uninstall musictracker? *

  * Delete C:\Program Files\Pidgin\plugins\musictracker.dll
  * Run regsvr32 /u "C:\Program Files\Pidgin\wmpuice.dll"
  * Delete C:\Program Files\Pidgin\wmpuice.dll
  * Delete any musictracker.mo files from C:\Program Files\Pidgin\locale\`*`\LC_MESSAGES

==5==
* How do I get my status to go back to the pidgin status message when player stops? *

Change the "Stopped/Off" Status Format in the musictracker plugin configuration to an
empty string.

==6==
* Player name is shown as "unknown" *

It is a limitation of the "MSN compatible" now playing interface that the player name is
not available, so %r is replaced with "unknown" in this case.

A useful [http://kentie.net/article/nowplaying/index.htm description of this interface]

==7==
* Doesn't work with Windows Media Player (0.4.5 and earlier)*

Sigh.

You must enable the plugin called "True Launch Bar Remote Control" in Windows Media
Player (accessible from the little arrow underneath Now Playing, Plugins, Other).

This plugin is implemented by wmp9.dll and seems to provide the hook needed for reporting WMP status messages.

I've removed wmp9.dll from the pidgin-musictrcker installer as the distribution rights are unclear.  Googling for "True Launch Bar" should find it :-)

Needless to say, this was a complete crock and was re-writtten for 0.4.6

==8==
* Doesn't work with foobar2000 (artist/track/title are blank) *

Direct foobar2000 player support is pretty fragile

  * The title format needs to be the default "[%album artist% - ]['['%album%[ CD%discnumber%][ #%tracknumber%]']' ]%title%[ '//' %track artist%]"
  * The player paused state isn't detected
  * It doesn't work when player is set to minimize to tray

However, foobar2000 is much better supported either via the [http://chron.visiondesigns.de/foobar2000/#foo_winamp_spam winamp spam] component (but this is still not perfect as some winamp messages we use aren't implemented) , or (better) via foobar2000 sending "now playing" messages for MSN, which we now catch.

So, with current versions of musictracker, the recommendation is to set player to 'auto-detect' or 'Messenger compatible', and not install the winamp-spam component.

The direct foobar2000 support will be removed at some future date.

==9==
* How do I build from source? *

Download and unpack the pidgin-musictracker-n.n.nn.tar.bz2 source package, then

{{{
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
}}}

for Windows

{{{
make -f Makefile.mingw installer
}}}

For the Windows build, as we currently rely on some of the pidgin build infrastructure,  you'll also need the pidgin source at the relative path ../pidgin,  with a win32-dev/ which has been populated by the Windows build dependency fetcher, winpidgin-build-fetcher.sh.  This source needs to be buildable, i.e. have an appropriate config.h and local.mak.

We don't provide and install a dynamic libpcre, so a static libpcre also needs to be made available, one approach is to place that in a directory under win32-dev/ and add that directory to the LIB_PATH set in local.mak

==10==
* How to I build the source from subversion? *

Usually, you don't!  The source tarballs available on the downloads page are nearly always a much better choice.  If you must have absolutely the lastest source, try the snapshots page.  But if you really want to build from subversion:

Perform the following steps before ./configure

{{{
echo my-hacked-up-version >version
./reconf
}}}

==11==
* Where are the linux binary packages? *

There are links to binary packages for some distros on the main page.  

It would be nice have them for all major distros, but ... :effort:

The downloads page offers a "Linux x86 plugin binary".  This shouldn't work anywhere but on the computer I used to build it, but often does.  Only people who are happy to troubleshoot their own problems should be installing that (and such people should be more than competent to build from source anyhow).  

You can drop the .so into /usr/lib/pidgin/ or ~/.purple/plugins/.

Debian (and Debian-derived distros e.g. Ubuntu) will also need to 'sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libpcre.so.3 /usr/lib/libpcre.so.0' for this binary to work.

==12==
* What does a "protocol has 'now listening'" mean? *

Some protocols (e.g. MSN) have a separate way of indicating 'now listening' information, so musictracker can potentially send the track information in two different ways: in your status message, and (for some protocols) in special 'now listening' element.

By default, musictracker will try to use both of these.

Internally, pidgin calls this 'now listening' data a 'tune status'.

Pidgin will show a music symbol next to a contact from whom it is receiving 'now playing' information, and if you hover the mouse over the contact, it will show you the 'now listening' and 'status' information in a tooltip.

If you don't want musictracker to set the status message for protocols where can send 'now
playing' information, tick the "Don't change status message if protocol has
working 'now listening'" option in the musictracker configuration.  This will cause musictracker to just send the 'now listening' element and not update
the status message.

Because musictracker needs help at the moment in some cases (specifically !GoogleTalk/XMPP) in determining if the 'now listening' element works properly or not, it is also possible to disable use of it in the account specific configuration.  At the moment, it is automatically disabled for all Googletalk and XMPP accounts.  This is correct for !GoogleTalk, but for non-!GoogleTalk XMPP accounts with working XEP-0118 you may wish to clear that setting to enable musictracker to use the 'now listening' support.

==13==
* How do I generate a debug log when pidgin is crashing? *

See the [http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/TipsForBugReports tips for bug reports] on the pidgin website for clear instructions.  Raise an issue *here* and attach the debug.log and pidgin.rpt files.
