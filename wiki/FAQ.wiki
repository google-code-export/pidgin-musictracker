= I installed musictracker, started my player and my status doesn't change =

Your outgoing status message is changed, as your correspondents should be able to tell you, but the status message shown in the pidgin UI is not updated.

This behaviour, whilst failing to provide clearly needed user feedback, is by design, at least for the moment.

Adding yourself to your own buddy list (if permitted by the protocol) may be one way of seeing your own status, or enabling the [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/mystatusbox MyStatusBox] plugin from the [http://plugins.guifications.org/trac/wiki/PluginPack Pidgin Plugin Pack]

= Windows installer fails "Error opening the file for writing musictracker.dll" =

You must exit pidgin to run the installer if you have a previous version of musictracker installed.

= Doesn't work with Windows Media Player (0.4.5 and earlier)=

Sigh.

You must enable the plugin called "True Launch Bar Remote Control" in Windows Media
Player (accessible from the little arrow underneath Now Playing, Plugins, Other).

This plugin is implemented by wmp9.dll and seems to provide the hook needed for reporting WMP status messages.

I've removed wmp9.dll from the pidgin-musictrcker installer as the distribution rights are unclear.  Googling for "True Launch Bar" should find it :-)

Needless to say, this was a complete crock and was re-writtten for 0.4.6

= Doesn't work with foobar2000 (artist/track/title are blank) =
 
foobar2000 player support is pretty fragile

The title format needs to be the default "[%album artist% - ]['['%album%[ CD%discnumber%][ #%tracknumber%]']' ]%title%[ '//' %track artist%]"

The player paused state isn't detected

It doesn't work when player is set to minimize to tray

Please consider using the [http://chron.visiondesigns.de/foobar2000/#foo_winamp_spam  winamp spam] component 

= How do I build the Subversion source? =

{{{
echo my-hacked-up-version >version
./reconf
./configure
make
}}}

for Windows

{{{
echo my-hacked-up-version >version
cd src
make -f Makefile.mingw installer
}}}

For the Windows build, as we currently rely on some of the pidgin build infrastructure,  you'll also need the pidgin source at the relative path ../pidgin,  with a win32-dev/ which has been populated by at Windows build dependency fetcher, winpidgin-build-fetcher.sh.  This source needs to be buildable, i.e. have an appropriate config.h and local.mak.

We don't provide and install a dynamic libpcre, so a static libpcre needs to be made available, one approach is to place that in a directory under win32-dev/ and add that directory to the LIB_PATH set in local.mak
